# ESP32-ADF with MAX98357A using platformio

This is a quick start example to use ESP32-ADF with the MAX98357A with platformio.

I hope this project saves you time. :-)

As this [issue](https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf/issues/848) mentions, is the es7148 driver identical to the MAX9357A.

## MAX98357A PIN Configuration
* BCLK 5
* LRC / (WS) 25
* DIN 26
